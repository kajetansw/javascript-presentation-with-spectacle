# JavaScript #10YearsChallenge Presentation (with Spectacle)

Slides I made about for presentation about how JavaScript evolved 
as a language and technologies surrounding JS. 

Main points of the presentation:
- My motivation,
- What JS is as a language,
- Is JS object-oriented or functional or none?
- JS before 2009,
- Release of NodeJS and npm,
- How JS is used now,
- Regulations of ECMAScript (TC 39),
- Why should we use JS.

## Quick View

You can see presendation under `./pdf/slides.pdf`. Unfortunately it may be poor in quality and cut on the edges.

## Reference

The Spectacle core API is available in the [Spectacle Docs](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/blob/master/README.md).

## Build & Deployment

Building the dist version of the project is as easy as running

```sh
yarn build
```

If you want to deploy the slideshow to surge, run

```sh
yarn deploy
```
